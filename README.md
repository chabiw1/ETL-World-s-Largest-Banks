# ETL-World-s-Largest-Banks
Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks

In this project, I will put all the skills acquired throughout the course and your knowledge of basic Python to test. I will work on real-world data and perform the operations of Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) as required.

Create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate information that has been made available to you as a CSV file. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.

Your job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report.
